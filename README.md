# Nyanners

very basic c++ game engine that i'll probably never finish. loosely based on how roblox is built.
also uses modern c++ (:D)

currently supports both windows and linux compilation
macos can die

# instructions

uhh, this may or may not even build on windows (made under arch linux) but basic premise is install cmake and raylib
then clone luau into vendor/luau and build Luau.Compiler, Luau.VM into vendor/libs/luau (make sure it's libLuau.VM.a or lib, or whatever)
